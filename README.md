Components: Can be created in two ways:
1. Functional components
   - Functional components are also called as stateless components.
   - Component life cycle does not apply to functional components.
   - are efficient than class components.
   - states can be used in functional components using hooks.
2. Class components
   - Class components are also lcalled as stateful components.
   - Component life cycle applies to class components.

Functional Components are better than class components for the following reasons:
- Functional components are easier to read and test.
- Functional components help you avoid `this` keyword and the confusion around it.
- Functional components can be easily extracted as separate function. 
- Functional  components can be better optimized by React/
- Functional components are less code. 
- Functional components are faster than class components.

State:
- a component's memory.
- a component's memory is used to store data.
- a component's
